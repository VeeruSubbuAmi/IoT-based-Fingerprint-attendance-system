# IoT-based-Fingerprint-attendance-system
In this project, I will tell you how to build an IoT based Fingerprint Biometric Attendance System using NodeMCU ESP8266 12E, 0.96” OLED Display &amp; SFG R305a Fingerprint Sensor. The ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module will collect the fingerprint data from the multiple users and sends it over the internet to a website. The Enrolment of fingerprints is done on the server using any fingerprint sensor like R303, R305 or R307 that is available on the market and verification of the fingerprint will be done on the webserver while fingerprint templates are transmitted over the WiFi.
